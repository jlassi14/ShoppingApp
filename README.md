# üõí Shopping List App ‚Äì UIKit

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  I completed this project without access to a macOS device or Xcode, simply because I currently don‚Äôt own one.
Despite that, I wanted to demonstrate my skills and commitment by manually writing all the code, structuring the app fully with UIKit, and following the test instructions precisely ‚Äî from UI layout to app logic and architecture .

## üåü Bonus Feature Implemented: **Categorization + Filtering**

| Feature                                | Implemented |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| Add a category per item                | ‚úÖ           |
| Store and filter items by category     | ‚úÖ           |

## üîê Additional Feature Added: **Mock Login + Per-user Data Persistence**

Although not required for the selected bonus, I also implemented:

- A basic **login screen** (mock authentication)
- Separate local data storage **per user**
- Simulated user-specific sessions with persistent storage

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to not having access to macOS/Xcode, `CoreData` could not be implemented. I used `UserDefaults` to simulate multi-user persistence, encoding data with `Codable`. In a real project, I would migrate to `CoreData`.
